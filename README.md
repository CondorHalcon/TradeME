## HOW TO PLAY
> Playing TradeME v1 is not as easy as I would like to make it. This will probably be made easier in a future release of the game when I add a GUI. For now the game is played in a terminal/console such as Command Prompt.

### THE ASSETS
> Assets are the things you can trade in TradeME. They are of different price ranges, never going below a certain price, and never above another. I have listeed below the assets included in TradeME v1.0 and there varring price ranges.

* Gold (low: 70, high:300)
* Silver (low: 60, high:170)
* Oil (low: 20, high:30)
* Food (low: 2, high:12)
* BSK (low: 5, high:8)
* NTSK (low: 1, high:4)
* OLSK (low: 5, high:9)

### COMMANDS
> The game is played with simple noCaps commads. The following is a list of all the commands.

* "bsk": identifys the BSK asset
* "buy": informs the system that you wish to buy an asset
* "food": identifys the Food asset
* "gold": identifys the Gold asset

### GAMEPLAY
> Once you run the game, the current turn prices of the assets will be listed followed by the assets you own. You can then choose what action you wish to take. You could buy, sell, pass, save or quit. If you choose to buy or sell, you will then need to identify the asset you wish to trade, followed by the amount. The next turn will then start.
